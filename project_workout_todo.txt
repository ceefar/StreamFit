SO
legit just do this through database and form
so user enters that form info
timer starts
timer ends
page reruns
the information fills any persisting fields from the database
and provides the logic for things like sets etc


RN
if set4 wipe everything and make dem continue - or sumnt similar maybe its just like a stats bit just the metric whatever its so sick omg
exercise 2


DB
create id - even if simple but just so is done duh (with name anonymity?)
verification for if you exist or not and simple db login!!!!!! - legit already have the code bosh af
show previous set in new dropdown by current info if vlaid
do simple running metric


YOU GOTTA THINK MORE MVP!
e.g.
- you dont need set timer and dynamic timer, just have it be dynamic only at the start!
