SO
legit just do this through database and form
so user enters that form info
timer starts
timer ends
page reruns
the information fills any persisting fields from the database
and provides the logic for things like sets etc

in this v0.2 version essentially treating muscle group like the equipment,
again isnt a big leap to implement equipment after this tho i do want the logic for it to be dynamic


RNRN
- the dropdown comparison to last set now the session id works
- then running metric at bottom or whatever that then will become more prominent on session ends
- then exercise 2, with button for when complete to go to next page (could pass stuff to it too if did want to oooo)
- basic dynamic timer? (own table (nah) or tbf own logic/function for it duh!)
- exercise/mg info and else similar? (or wait til equipment?)
- then actually tbh need to add the equipment stuff otherwise wtf are you tracking lmao
    - at this point refactor likely best but thats fine
    - MAKE SESSION ID AN INT!
    - ADD TIMESTAMP
    - MAKE SESSION ID AN ACTUAL SESSION ID BUT CREATE A NEW SESSION NUMBER TOO!
    - BE SURE TO STRIP STRINGS WHEN ADDED TO DB


RN
obvs you're not actually selecting any equipment yet or being recommended it or anything modifiers based on the type of the exercise!
exercise 2
add drop all tables functionality (button) to home page (needs a new db function tbf) - this will then be an admin only thing
can/should use side bar more


DB
create id - even if simple but just so is done duh (with name anonymity?)
verification for if you exist or not and simple db login!!!!!! - legit already have the code bosh af
show previous set in new dropdown by current info if valid
do simple running metric
should include datetime of session btw
make session id an int 
add new session id for actual id style id (use uuid?)


YOU GOTTA THINK MORE MVP!
e.g.
- you dont need set timer and dynamic timer, just have it be dynamic only at the start!


FUTURE
- obvs must set up so when user hits timer logic happens, so they can also skip the timer should they wish without logic errors
- if that requires an extra button press by them (i.e. to force rerun) that is fine
