## StreamFit  
  
#### What is it?  
Personal Project [Stalled] - Streamlit fitness (particuarly gym based) web app which allows you to select a workplan from Exrx.net and run through it while logging your results and stats to a database. Is actually a really cool project that I enjoy working on a lot, though is suprisingly complicated, not just due to data but also due to Streamlits control flow which gives many issues.   
  
#### Where is it now?  
Is in a highly unfinished/unstable state, but will return to this in future. Stalled due to control flow issues and working on Data Engineering bootcamp projects, have learned a lot about control flow and streamlit sicne then so am really excited to get back to this.  
Have seriously considered learning Flutter in my freetime instead of a project like this since Streamlit is far from it's ideal usecase.  
Will add images/video from the webapp, and more details on the project in this readme shortly
