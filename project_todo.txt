# FOUNDATIONAL
adding this stuff as obvs is foundational but also is a good time to get more comfy with base level things like...
    - logging
    - unit tests

# BASICS


# APP NOTES
- isn't this massive better in intro bit as book ting?


# QUICK NOTES
- obvs the basic logger with timer
- obvs basic stats
    - running weights and various
    - end stats
- more advanced is adding in when consistent enough at ceiling prompt to increase (and inverse for decrease)\
- changing equipment, only valid, with recommendation
    - then improve that to be based off user level
- onboarding to set things like user level etc (could do equip then but they can skip too, being sure to reprompt them at a fitting time)
- selecting equipment during a long break for ease in future
