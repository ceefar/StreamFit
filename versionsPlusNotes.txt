v0.3 - ONGOING


Would Like This Sprint (i.e. today)
-----------------------------------


HERE RN!
- MAKE NEW PAGE FOR ONCE SELECTED SINCE RERUNS OTHERWISE UNLESS IS A WAY TO CUT IT OFF WITH A FUNCTION BUT DOUBT IT NEW PAGE EASY ENOUGH DW!

- from there actually converting from just mg logging stats to equipmentexercise logging stats
    - using link name for saving might actually be best since is unique?!
    - legit exactly how they are in images folder bosh



IMPORTANT!
- before below should first implement a simple -> if img in images folder then add to cache function that either runs at start or runs when loading the image


- preload "most popular" (dummified for now obvs) 
    - smart thing to do would be obvs just to do it for the 1st exercise so would need to know that before start the load
    - do this in the main page with a button - or even a preliminary page (with some basic data and a progress bar, like tutorial tips ooo)
    - that then loads in popular shit while u do the tutorial, or if youve done the tutorial but havent done the mg before loads the exercises

- check if img exists in cache first before doing anything
    - for returning users duh
    - as in sure the word images might not be in session state but that doesnt mean there arent images
        - so if there are images in there, initialise ["images"] and load them or figure it out whatever 
        - just means adding their names to session state i swear?

- set the equipment, pull from db more info on it
    - again use a prog bar or spinner here (prog bar nice to learn?) 



Completed 
----------

- ideally hiding rest of the display or making it not active to use anything else until is valid to do so (hide probably easier and better tho btw)
- start with an expander of exercise info pulled dynamically from webpage!
- with metrics of compound etc (which are in db tbf so load them first!)
    
    Basic Equipment Implementation (mostly completed anyways)
- basic image screenshotter, using seleium for ss and removing popup with xpath, pil for image crop
    - only one site image tested so far
- load screenshotted image to site for preview
    - various considerations for this currently implementing (see below)
- equip selector and pulling db data
- db automator backend admin panel super basics but does the job
- currently implementing sessionState[images] dictionary to store images as basic cache functionality
- dynamic name creation for image names based on links
- pulling data from db based on various types of formatted names (kinda long tho should use a dict for displayName and DBusable name or sumnt similar ??)
- clean loading and cache working basics for chest, both parent only and parent child cases semi tested, is <3



To Do Soon
-----------------------------------

- actually equipment recommendations based on level etc
- pre choosing your equipment / the prompt for it, so you are only recommended what you have
- proper onboarding for level, time off, target muscle, etc
