[THEN DO OTHER TUTS?!] && NEW MINI PROJECT

- exercise/mg info and else similar? (or wait til equipment?)
    - yeah just do basic and do it using webscaping ooooo!
    - N0TE PROBS JUST DO THE ACTUAL EXERCISES MANUALLY THEN ADD IN THE INFORMATION DYNAMICALLY! (since children n shit n no tags)
        - maybe in theory can do it tho idk, maybe its like half and half, pull the date using bs4 then basically manually edit it heavily per page
            - NOTE should just bang it in DB TABLES FOR EACH MUSCLE DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! <<<<<<<<<< THIS!
                - legit only need to do for chest to start duh!
                    - NOTE add a basic equipment selector too! - dropdown or sumnt oooo!!!!

- some basic "modifier" logic before 1st big refactor
    - remember need this functionality to be good as will be adding my own modifiers which allow for like heavy long rest or short explosive/lighter etc is important tho 

- then maybe try to get to the end of a session

- the basic functionality for if 11,11,11 (close to ceiling) then prompt to increase weight
    - initially just do based on an arbitrary value, but for proper (needs planning) obvs need sets n rep range to be preset or dynamically provided

- quickly do end stuff basic -> real world comparison etc just to test!
    - (and other stuff (see above) like weeks on exercise etc, dummy charts etc, dummy data is fine for now but needs to be done properly in terms of planning for db!)
    - lifted this session week month etc (running)
- then running metric at bottom or whatever that then will become more prominent on session ends
    - skip for now but still do in this "sprint/version" 
        - include stuff for like total time on session
        - the real world weight comparisons <3
        - basic metric idea for like "predicted improvement" (i.e. how many more sessions at which it thinks you'll be able to increase the weights)
        - weeks on exercise (obvs only need for equipment), is a big one tho as leave to early isnt ideal, and neither is late!
        - rate of progress (defo dont do now) but like a chart that maps it over time, could do a dummy now tbf
        - many others for sure

- then actually tbh need to add the equipment stuff otherwise wtf are you tracking lmao
    - at this point refactor likely best but thats fine
    - MAKE SESSION ID AN INT!
    - ADD TIMESTAMP
    - MAKE SESSION ID AN ACTUAL SESSION ID BUT CREATE A NEW SESSION NUMBER TOO!
    - BE SURE TO STRIP STRINGS WHEN ADDED TO DB


RN
obvs you're not actually selecting any equipment yet or being recommended it or anything modifiers based on the type of the exercise!
exercise 2
add drop all tables functionality (button) to home page (needs a new db function tbf) - this will then be an admin only thing
can/should use side bar more


DB
create id - even if simple but just so is done duh (with name anonymity?)
verification for if you exist or not and simple db login!!!!!! - legit already have the code bosh af
show previous set in new dropdown by current info if valid
do simple running metric
should include datetime of session btw
make session id an int 
add new session id for actual id style id (use uuid?)


IMPORTANT
- tapping prev total weight (or any selector ig) while timer is going will just end the timer, need a fix for this!
- lbs and kg converter functions


YOU GOTTA THINK MORE MVP!
e.g.
- you dont need set timer and dynamic timer, just have it be dynamic only at the start!


FUTURE
- obvs must set up so when user hits timer logic happens, so they can also skip the timer should they wish without logic errors
- if that requires an extra button press by them (i.e. to force rerun) that is fine 


GENERAL CONCEPT FOR CURRENT VERSION
legit just do this through database and form
so user enters that form info
timer starts
timer ends
page reruns
the information fills any persisting fields from the database
and provides the logic for things like sets etc

in this v0.2 version essentially treating muscle group like the equipment,
again isnt a big leap to implement equipment after this tho i do want the logic for it to be dynamic



DONE
- the dropdown comparison to last set now the session id works [DONE]
- if doing a session for first time fix error [THINK DONE - HAVEN'T THOROUGHLY TESTED THO]
- basic dynamic timer? (own table (nah) or tbf own logic/function for it duh!) [DONE, NOT TRULY TESTED, RUDIMENTARY AF]
    - yeah own function in a different file! (integration_workout!)
- then exercise 2 basic, with button for when complete to go to next page (could pass stuff to it too if did want to oooo)
