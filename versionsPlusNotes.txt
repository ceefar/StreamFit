v0.3 - ONGOING

Basic Equipment Implementation
------------------------------

- basic image screenshotter, using seleium for ss and removing popup with xpath, pil for image crop
    - only one site image tested so far
- load screenshotted image to site for preview
    - various considerations for this currently implementing (see below)
- equip selector and pulling db data
- db automator backend admin panel super basics but does the job
- currently implementing sessionState[images] dictionary to store images as basic cache functionality
- dynamic name creation for image names based on links
- pulling data from db based on various types of formatted names (kinda long tho should use a dict for displayName and DBusable name or sumnt similar ??)
- clean loading and cache working basics for chest, both parent only and parent child cases semi tested, is <3



Would Like This Sprint (i.e. today)
-----------------------------------

- set the equipment, pull from db more info on it
    - ideally hiding rest of the display or making it not active to use anything else until is valid to do so (hide probably easier and better tho btw)

- from there actually converting from just mg logging stats to equipmentexercise logging stats
    - (using link name for saving might actually be best since is unique?!)

- preload "most popular" (dummified for now obvs) 
    - smart thing to do would be obvs just to do it for the 1st exercise so would need to know that before start the load
    - do this in the main page with a button - or even a preliminary page (with some basic data and a progress bar, like tutorial tips ooo)
    - that then loads in popular shit while u do the tutorial, or if youve done the tutorial but havent done the mg before loads the exercises



To Do Soon
-----------------------------------

- actually equipment recommendations based on level etc
- pre choosing your equipment / the prompt for it, so you are only recommended what you have
- proper onboarding for level, time off, target muscle, etc
